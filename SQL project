Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help 
you profile and understand the data just  like a data scientist would. For this first part of the 
assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, 
as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. 
You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments 
where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of 
the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset
for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy
your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being
 asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet
so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor 
(Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. 
If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your 
answers and code are lined appropriately. In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your 
formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table = 10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table = 10,000
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table = 10,000
	

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys
are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10,000
ii. Hours = 1,562
iii. Category = 2,643
iv. Attribute = 1,115
v. Review = 10,000(using id)
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10,000
viii. Tip = 3,979(using business_id)
ix. User = 10,000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2,780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: NO

Explain: We can see that posing more reviews does not have correlation with more fans. I created a query 
here to order review_count and fans both by descending order and see that there are users with much less
reviews but are still fans of more business. On the other hand, there are users with really high number of reviews 
but are not fans of lots of business like Sara and Yuri. 

9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: There are more reviews with love than hate


	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT COUNT(text) as love_count
FROM review
WHERE text LIKE '%love%' 
	

+------------+
| love_count |
+------------+
|       1780 |
+------------+

SELECT COUNT(text) as love_count
FROM review
WHERE text LIKE '%hate%' 

+------------+
| love_count |
+------------+
|        232 |
+------------+
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
SELECT id, name, fans
FROM user
ORDER BY fans DESC
LIMIT 10

	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
+------------------------+-----------+------+

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or 
category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses 
with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

SELECT 
postal_code, AVG(stars)
FROM business
INNER JOIN category
ON business.id = category.business_id
WHERE category = 'Restaurants' and city ='Phoenix'
GROUP BY 
postal_code
ORDER BY AVG(stars) DESC





SQL code used for analysis:

--I first join business table with category table and show id, name, city, category and stars

SELECT id, name, city, category, stars
FROM business
INNER JOIN category
ON business.id = category.business_id

|   4.5 |             7.0 |
+-------+-----------------+


--> We can see that 4-5 stars restaurant have far higher reviews on average than 2-3 stars restaurant in Phoenix.




SELECT 
postal_code, AVG(stars)

postal_code

| 85024       |        3.0 |
| 85004       |        2.0 |
+-------------+------------+


--> We can see that postal code 85034 has the highest average rating restaurants and when I check on the map, 
it is actually in the business and airport area of Phoenix while other postal code which have lower average 
rating are not near those area. It makes perfect sense that the business in
this expensive areas have to be good in order to survive in a high-class market. 


2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find
between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

SELECT is_open, ROUND(AVG(stars),2) AS average_rating
FROM business
INNER JOIN category
ON business.id = category.business_id
GROUP BY is_open
      

+---------+----------------+
| is_open | average_rating |
+---------+----------------+
|       0 |           3.66 |
|       1 |            3.9 |
+---------+----------------+

--> We can see that on average, open business have higher average rating than closed business which makes sense 
but the difference are not significant. It may mean that business that are open can still have low rating 
as the case with fast food restaurants when they do not need to have very high rating to survive in the food market. 
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
SELECT is_open, ROUND(AVG(review_count),2) AS average_review
FROM business
INNER JOIN category
ON business.id = category.business_id
GROUP BY is_open

+---------+----------------+
| is_open | average_review |
+---------+----------------+
|       0 |          36.91 |
|       1 |          56.67 |
+---------+----------------+         
         
--> We can see that on average, open business have higher average number of reviews than closed business. 
This is understandable since business that were closed tend to have less attention than business that 
are still in the market, so they would receive much less reviews.


	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct 
on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering 
businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, 
predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, 
so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, 
to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:



SELECT category
,COUNT(category) as number_of_business
,ROUND(AVG(stars),2) as average_rating
FROM business
INNER JOIN category
ON business.id = category.business_id
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(category) >10
ORDER BY AVG(stars) DESC


+------------------------+--------------------+----------------+

| Shopping               |                 30 |           3.98 |
| Beauty & Spas          |                 13 |           3.88 |
| American (Traditional) |                 11 |           3.82 |
| Food                   |                 23 |           3.78 |
| Bars                   |                 17 |            3.5 |
| Nightlife              |                 20 |           3.48 |
| Restaurants            |                 71 |           3.46 |
+------------------------+--------------------+----------------+

--> Local Services, Health and Home Services are among the best rating business with at least 4.0 average rating. 
On the other hand, we can see that food industry have the lowest average rating. This seems to be understandable since 
Food services tend to be more subjective in terms of customers taste and preference so there may be a wider range of
Ratings in this industry.

+------------------------+--------------------+-----------------+


--> From this query, we can see that food industry take the top spots when it comes to average reviews for a business. 
This actually relates to the previous opinion about the fact that people tend to leave more reviews after a food experience 
Other than other after using non-food services since food deal directly more with customers' emotions and behaviors.

--> In terms of location, Ohio, Arizona and Nevada seems to have highest average reviews. It may need further data and analysis 
But we can somehow conclude in this case that if a new business is open in these locations, is is more likely to attract 
New customers maybe due to the demographics and culture of customers here who love to try new services.
